FireLogger for Chrome
====================================

FireLogger for Chrome is an extension that can substitute [FireLogger](http://firelogger.binaryage.com/). It is a fork of [xifs/chrome-firelogger](https://github.com/xifs/chrome-firelogger), however completely rewritten from scratch to work with the newest Chrome. It works great together with [Tracy](https://github.com/nette/tracy) debugging tool, which also helps you to debug errors in AJAX calls.

How to install
--------------

1. Clone the repository and install an extension into Chrome (Tools - Extensions - Load unpacked extension...).
2. Open Developer Tools.
3. Messages are being logged into the Console tab.
